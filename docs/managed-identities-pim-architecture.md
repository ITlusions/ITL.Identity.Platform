# Architecture Overview - Legacy Document

**⚠️ This document has been superseded by the TOGAF-structured architecture documentation.**

**Please refer to the comprehensive architecture documentation in the `/architecture/` folder:**

## Complete Architecture Documentation

### TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)

- **[Architecture Vision (Phase A)](architecture/overview.md)** - Strategic context, business drivers, and architecture principles
- **[Business Architecture (Phase B)](architecture/business-architecture.md)** - Business processes, organizational model, and requirements  
- **[Information Architecture (Phase C)](architecture/information-architecture.md)** - Data architecture, application architecture, and integration patterns
- **[Technology Architecture (Phase D)](architecture/technology-architecture.md)** - Technology components, deployment patterns, and infrastructure specifications
- **[Implementation Planning (Phases E-H)](architecture/implementation-planning.md)** - Migration strategy, governance framework, and success metrics

### Supporting Documentation

- **[Way of Working](architecture/way-of-working.md)** - TOGAF implementation approach, governance framework, and architecture decision records
- **[TOGAF Appendix](appendix/togaf-appendix.md)** - TOGAF concepts, methodology overview, and deliverables matrix
- **[Compliance Mapping](appendix/compliance-mapping.md)** - Regulatory compliance mappings and control frameworks
- **[Security Framework](appendix/security-framework.md)** - Security patterns, controls, and baseline requirements

## Key Content Migration

All content from this document has been integrated into the appropriate TOGAF phase documents:

- **Executive Summary** → Architecture Vision
- **Technical Configurations** → Technology Architecture  
- **Risk Register** → Implementation Planning
- **Architecture Decision Records** → Way of Working
- **Reference Implementations** → Technology Architecture
