### Human Access Management

#### Access Request Process

    A[User Needs Access] --> B{Access Type?}
    B -->|Infrastructure| C[Request via Teleport]
    B -->|Application| D[Request via PIM Broker]
    
    C --> E[Manager Approval]
    D --> F[App Owner Approval]
    
    E --> G[Security Review]
    F --> H[Security Review]
    
    G --> I[Grant Time-Limited Access]
    H --> J[Issue Elevated Token]
    
    I --> K[Automatic Expiration]
    J --> L[Token Expiration]
    
    K --> M[Access Audit Log]
    L --> M
```

**Process Steps**

1. **Request Initiation**
   - User submits access request with justification
   - System validates user eligibility and request scope
   - Request routed to appropriate approval workflow

2. **Approval Workflow**
   - Manager approval for infrastructure access
   - Application owner approval for application access
   - Security team review for high-privilege requests

3. **Access Provisioning**
   - Automated credential issuance upon approval
   - Time-bounded access with automatic expiration
   - Real-time notification to requester and approvers

4. **Access Monitoring**
   - Continuous monitoring of active sessions
   - Audit logging of all access activities
   - Alerting on anomalous access patterns

5. **Access Revocation**
   - Automatic expiration based on time limits
   - Manual revocation for security incidents
   - Cleanup of temporary permissions and credentials

#### Emergency Access Process

**Trigger Conditions**

- Production incidents requiring immediate access

- Security incidents requiring rapid response

- Business-critical operations outside normal hours

**Process Flow**

1. **Emergency Declaration**: Incident commander declares emergency access need

2. **Accelerated Approval**: Emergency approval by on-call security personnel

3. **Extended Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and monitoring during emergency access

4. **Post-Incident Review**: Mandatory review of emergency access usage

### Workload Identity Management

#### Application Onboarding

    B --> C[SPIFFE Entry Creation]
    C --> D[Policy Definition]
    D --> E[Deployment Integration]
    E --> F[Validation Testing]
    F --> G[Production Rollout]
```

**Process Steps**

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Application team defines identity requirements
   - Security team reviews access patterns
   - Platform team validates technical feasibility

2. **Identity Configuration**
   - SPIFFE entries created for workload selectors
   - OPA policies defined for access control
   - Integration patterns documented

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Identity attestation verified in test environment
   - Access patterns validated against policies
   - Performance impact assessed

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Gradual rollout with monitoring
   - Validation of identity issuance and verification
   - Documentation updates and team training

#### Token Exchange Process

**Business Flow**

1. **Application Authentication**: Workload obtains SPIFFE identity

2. **Privilege Request**: Application requests elevated permissions

3. **Token Exchange**: SPIFFE identity exchanged for application token

4. **Authorized Operations**: Application performs privileged operations

5. **Token Expiration**: Access automatically revokes after time limit
