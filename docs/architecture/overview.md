# Architecture Overview

This section provides the complete TOGAF-based architecture documentation for the ITL Identity Platform, following the Architecture Development Method (ADM) phases.

## Architecture Vision

The ITL Identity Platform delivers **Azure-style managed identities and Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** on Kubernetes using our existing **Keycloak** infrastructure for IAM, **SPIFFE/SPIRE** for workload identity, and **Teleport** for JIT elevation, plus an optional **PIM Broker** for application token exchange via Keycloak Token Exchange.

**Mission**: Enable consistent, auditable, short-lived identity for people and workloads across multi-cluster Kubernetes, with PIM/approval workflows and centralized policy governance.

### Key Outcomes

**No long-lived credentials in applications**
- Replace static secrets with SPIFFE identities and short-lived tokens/certificates
- Implement secretless workload patterns across all applications

**Time-bound privileged access**
- Human/Service access elevated only after approval, with short TTL and full audit
- 100% of admin actions via JIT (with justification) by Q2

**Unified identity fabric**
- Consistent identity management across clusters and tenants
- Multi-tenant Keycloak realms with clear RBAC boundaries

### Key Performance Indicators

- **90% reduction in static secrets** within 3 months
- **100% of admin actions via JIT** (with justification) by Q2  
- **Mean approval time < 5 minutes**
- **< 60 minutes MTTR** to revoke elevated access

### Strategic Context

**Business Drivers**

- **Zero-trust security** requirements for cloud-native applications

- **Compliance mandates** for privileged access management

- **Developer productivity** through secretless workload patterns

- **Operational efficiency** via automation and self-service

**Scope & Boundaries**

- **In Scope**: Kubernetes workload identity, infrastructure access, application PIM

- **Out of Scope**: Legacy application integration, non-Kubernetes environments

- **Constraints**: Must integrate with existing Keycloak, OSS-preferred solutions

### Architecture Principles

**Security First**

- **Principle**: Never trust, always verify

- **Rationale**: Zero-trust approach minimizes blast radius

- **Implications**: All access requires authentication and authorization

**Least Privilege**

- **Principle**: Minimum necessary permissions with time-bound access

- **Rationale**: Reduces risk of privilege escalation and lateral movement

- **Implications**: Just-in-time access patterns, short-lived credentials

**Automation First**

- **Principle**: Automate identity lifecycle and access decisions

- **Rationale**: Reduces human error and improves consistency

- **Implications**: Policy-as-code, GitOps deployment patterns

**Observable Operations**

- **Principle**: Comprehensive audit trails for all access

- **Rationale**: Compliance requirements and security monitoring

- **Implications**: Centralized logging, real-time alerting

## Success Criteria

### Key Performance Indicators
