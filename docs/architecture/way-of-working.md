#### Current ADRs

**ADR-001: Use SPIFFE/SPIRE for Workload Identity**

- **Status**: Accepted

- **Context**: Need for secretless workload authentication

- **Decision**: Implement SPIFFE/SPIRE for portable, cryptographic workload identity

- **Rationale**: Enables secretless applications, supports federation, industry standard

- **Consequences**: Requires learning curve, adds operational complexity

**ADR-002: Integrate with Existing Keycloak Instance**

- **Status**: Accepted

- **Context**: Organization already uses Keycloak for user identity

- **Decision**: Extend existing Keycloak for platform identity management

- **Rationale**: Leverages existing investment, maintains consistent user experience

- **Consequences**: Must work within Keycloak constraints, upgrade dependencies

**ADR-003: Deploy Teleport for Infrastructure Access**

- **Status**: Accepted

- **Context**: Need for JIT infrastructure access with audit trails

- **Decision**: Use Teleport for SSH and Kubernetes access management

- **Rationale**: Purpose-built for infrastructure access, comprehensive audit capabilities

- **Consequences**: Additional component to operate, learning curve for ops team

**ADR-004: Implement OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange for Application PIM**

- **Status**: Accepted

- **Context**: Applications need JIT elevated privileges for sensitive operations

- **Decision**: Use Keycloak Token Exchange for short-lived elevated access tokens

- **Rationale**: Standards-based approach, integrates with existing Keycloak infrastructure

- **Consequences**: Requires application modifications, token validation complexity

**ADR-005: Use OPA/Gatekeeper for Policy Enforcement**

- **Status**: Accepted

- **Context**: Need for consistent policy enforcement across Kubernetes clusters

- **Decision**: Deploy OPA Gatekeeper for admission control and policy validation

- **Rationale**: Kubernetes-native, flexible policy language, GitOps integration

- **Consequences**: Policy complexity, requires Rego expertise

**ADR-006: Enforce MFA for All Elevation Requests**

- **Status**: Accepted

- **Context**: Security requirement for privileged access

- **Decision**: Mandate multi-factor authentication for any elevation request

- **Rationale**: Reduces risk of compromised accounts, compliance requirement

- **Consequences**: Additional user friction, MFA infrastructure requirements

**ADR-007: Prefer Granular Kubernetes Roles Over Cluster-Admin**

- **Status**: Accepted

- **Context**: Production security requires least-privilege access

- **Decision**: Define specific roles instead of using cluster-admin for production

- **Rationale**: Minimizes blast radius, aligns with principle of least privilege

- **Consequences**: More complex role management, requires regular review
