```

#### Migration Patterns

**Database Migration Pattern**

```yaml
database_migration:
  strategy: Blue-Green with data synchronization
  approach:
    1. Setup new Keycloak database
    2. Export user data from legacy systems
    3. Transform and import to Keycloak
    4. Validate data integrity
    5. Switch authentication endpoints
    6. Verify user access
    7. Decommission legacy systems
  
  rollback_plan:
    - Maintain legacy system in standby
    - Database snapshots before migration
    - Quick switch back capability
    - Data synchronization validation
  
  validation_criteria:
    - User count matches legacy system
    - Authentication success rate > 99%
    - Group memberships preserved
    - Application access functional
```

**Application Integration Pattern**

```yaml
application_integration:
  strategy: Gradual rollout with feature flags
  approach:
    1. Assess application authentication mechanism
    2. Implement OIDC/OAuth integration
    3. Deploy with feature flag disabled
    4. Test with subset of users
    5. Enable feature flag for all users
    6. Monitor for issues
    7. Remove legacy authentication
  
  testing_approach:
    - Automated integration tests
    - User acceptance testing
    - Performance impact validation
    - Security compliance verification
  
  rollback_plan:
    - Feature flag immediate disable
    - Fallback to legacy authentication
